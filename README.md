# robinhood-algo

This repo contains a forked gem of [robinhood-ruby](https://github.com/rememberlenny/robinhood-ruby) that includes updates to Robinhood's private API calls. So far, only OAuth and retrieving quotes have been verified as functioning.

I am not sure how useful this will end up being but I thought this would be a fun thing to try to automate. I am still new to trading on this platform and developing any algorithms that may go along with it.
